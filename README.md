# GeneralLedger.jl
# ML for GL - Machine Learning for General Ledger

## Work in progress - please DO NOT clone this repository ##

## Objective 
Provide a complete Data Science framework for Finance Data Analytics.

Scope of this package includes General Ledger, sub-ledgers, accounting Analytics & Data Science operations using 
<a href="https://julialang.org/"><img src="https://julialang.org/assets/infra/logo.svg" alt="The Julia Lang" width="40"/></a> language.


This package will support all computations for a complete Procure_to_Pay life cycle operation.
i.e. Orders -> Requestions -> Procurement -> Inventory cycle counting -> Match Exceptions -> Receivables -> Accounts Payables/Billing -> GL Accounting -> General Ledger book keeping.

Finance sub-ledger/accounting entries are necessary to accurately predict/analyze complete General Ledger functonalities.

note -> all sub-ledger/domain specific account will be covered in their own domains like AccountsPayables.jl, AccountsReceivables.jl, Procurement.jl etc.
