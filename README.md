## Objective 
Machine learning for General Ledger provide a complete Data Science framework for Finance Data Analytics.
Scope of this package includes Finance General Ledger, sub-ledgers, accounting entries analytics and complex Data Science operations using The <a href="https://julialang.org/"><img src="https://julialang.org/assets/infra/logo.svg" alt="The Julia Lang" width="40"/></a> language.

```
In future, This package will support all data science computations for a complete Buy2Pay, Order2Cash, including Procurement life cycle business operations.
i.e. Orders -> Requestions -> Procurement -> Inventory cycle counting -> Match Exceptions -> Receivables -> Accounts Payables/Billing -> GL Accounting -> General Ledger book keeping.
```

Finance General Ledger sits at core of ERP systems and supporting sub-ledger/accounting entries/details are necessary to accurately predict/analyze complete General Ledger functionalities.

note -> all sub-ledger/domain specific account will be covered in their own domains like Buy2Pay.jl, TaxAnalytics.jl etc.

## using Pluto, Julia in Finance Supply Chain ERP systems as Business Intelligence Analytics, Prediction Analytics Reporting Tool

Package [Documentation](https://amitxshukla.github.io/GeneralLedger.jl/) include tutorials, example Pluto notebooks,
how Julia with Pluto as an Enterprise Reporting tool provide a cohesive data platform for **real-time, reactive/observable, ad-hoc and analytical, predictive analytics** reporting for ERP systems.

A typical ERP system consists of many modules based on business domain, functions and operations.
GL is the core of Finance and Supply chain domains like Buy to Pay, Order to Cash deal with different business operations in an Organization.
Many organizations use ERPs in different ways and may choose to implement all or some of the modules.

Read, Write and Understand and three different aspects of ERP data, while these ERP systems master write part",
Julia languages is the language for data science operations and large datasets numerical computing.

Julia language provide a range of packages suitable for  data loading, data wrangling, transformation, predictive analytics to perform all ERP business processes reporting & analytics.
