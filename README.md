# ML_for_GL - Machine Learning for General Ledger

## Work in progress - please DO NOT clone this repository ##

Objective of this GeneralLedger.jl package is to provide a complete Data Science framework for Finance Analytics.
This package includes not only General Ledger, but Sub-Ledger anlytics as well.
For example, it provides all tools to compute from a complete Procure to Pay life cycle 
i.e. order requestions -> procurement -> inventory cycle counting -> match exceptions -> Receivables -> Accounts Payables/Billing -> GL Accounting -> General Ledger book keeping.

Finance sub-ledger/accounting entries are necessary to accurately predict/analyze complete General Ledger functonality.

note -> all sub-ledger/domain specific account will be covered in their own domains like AccountsPayables.jl, AccountsReceivables.jl, Procurement.jl etc.
Open for funding/sponsorship.
