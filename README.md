[Documentation](https://amitxshukla.github.io/GeneralLedger.jl/)

## Objective 
Machine learning for General Ledger provide a complete Data Science framework for Finance Data Analytics.
Scope of this package includes Finance General Ledger, sub-ledgers, accounting entries analytics and complex Data Science operations using The <a href="https://julialang.org/"><img src="https://julialang.org/assets/infra/logo.svg" alt="The Julia Lang" width="40"/></a> language.

```
In future, This package will support all data science computations for a complete Procure_to_Pay life cycle operations.
i.e. Orders -> Requestions -> Procurement -> Inventory cycle counting -> Match Exceptions -> Receivables -> Accounts Payables/Billing -> GL Accounting -> General Ledger book keeping.
```

Finance General Ledger sits at core of ERP systems and supporting sub-ledger/accounting entries/details are necessary to accurately predict/analyze complete General Ledger functionalities.

note -> all sub-ledger/domain specific account will be covered in their own domains like Buy2Pay.jl, TaxAnalytics.jl etc.

```
This project is open for funding/sponsorship.
