### Objective
GeneralLedger.jl provide a complete Data Science Framework for Finance Data Analytics.
Scope of this package includes General Ledger, Sub-Ledgers, Accounting Analytics & Data Science operations using [![JuliaLang](images/julia.png)](https://julialang.org) language. GeneralLedger.jl supports analytics using structured data from ERP systems like
Oracle, PeopleSoft, SAP, Tally, Intuit, QuickBooks etc.

```

Finance sub-ledger/accounting entries (i.e. ProcureToPay) are necessary to accurately predict/analyze complete General Ledger functonalities at organizaion level.
!!! note "Procure to Pay!"

    This package supports all Finance analytical computations for a complete Procure_to_Pay life cycle operation from big ERP systems like
    Oracle, PeopleSoft, SAP, Tally, Intuit, QuickBooks etc.

    I will cover examples from ERP Domains like GL (General Ledger), AP (Accounts Payable), AR (Account Receivables), B2P (Buy to Pay), Expense, Travel & Time, HCM Human Capital Management, CRM etc.

    Requestions -> Orders -> Procurement -> Inventory cycle counting -> Match Exceptions -> Receivables -> Accounts Payables/Billing/Liability -> GL Accounting -> General Ledger book keeping.

    Future work : - All sub-ledger/domain specific account will be covered in their own domains like AccountsPayables.jl, AccountsReceivables.jl, Procurement.jl etc.
