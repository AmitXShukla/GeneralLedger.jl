# About General Ledger


## what is General Ledger

GL serves as core of any Financial Management system.

It's objective is to keep detail and summary accounting information and produce numerous financial reports for your organization.
Typical, you will hear Cash Flow, Income and Balance Sheet statements as SEC filings as financial reports indicating Organizations financial growth.
In general, accountants, statistical analysts strongly feel that financial reports from General Ledger are true indicator of organizations growth.


## Technical Analysis

is the process of forecasting future Organization growth or stock prices based on studying (using advance charting and applying mathematical formulas) past stock prices and trading volume.
Technical analysis strongly believes that at any given point of time, stock price and trading volume reflects it current value and charting accurately captures all factors which can cause upwards or downwards stock prices movement.

## Fundamental Analysis

is the process of forecasting future Organization growth or stock prices based on studying company financial statements like Income Statements, Cash Flow and Balance Sheets.

## Techno-Fundamental Analysis

In this notebook and all my follow-up GL notebooks, I am proposing to use 3rd type of analysis.
With the use of Machine Learning, one can apply ML algorithms to GL and SUB Ledger (accounting entries) Books.
Techno-fundamental analysis is not new, however, its seen very difficult because its requires big data and large computation.

Julia language provides fast computations for large data sets and great assets for Statistical programming.

In a nutshell, GL is simply about Credit & Debit, You Credit you saving accounts once you generate revenue on your sales, and make money. You debit your cash accounts because you have to pay your workforce, or invest in your assets..
Credit & Debit difference, is for you to keep, and totally up to you decide how to wisely spend you earnings.
Obviously, its not this simple, its a typical for large Organizations to employ 1000 people just to do these operations.
Due to complexity of these business processes Its very easy to get distracted and lose focus, So throughout this ML_for_GL journey discussed in this package, we will stick to these fundamentals and quickly come back to core GL and avoid jumping into sub-ledger operations too much in depth.
