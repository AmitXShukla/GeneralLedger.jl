now a very good function approximator to f(x) = ones(5)! So Why Machine Learning? Why Neural Networks? All we did was find parameters that made NN(x) act like a function f(x). How does that relate to machine learning? Well, in any case where one is acting on data (x,y), the idea is to assume that there exists some underlying mathematical model f(x) = y. If we had perfect knowledge of what f is, then from only the information of x we can then predict what y would be. The inference problem is to then figure out what function f should be. Therefore, machine learning on data is simply this problem of finding an approximator to some unknown function! So why neural networks? Neural networks satisfy two properties. The first of which is known as the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT), which in simple non-mathematical language means that, for any ϵ of accuracy, if your neural network is large enough (has enough layers, the weight matrices are large enough), then it can approximate any (nice) function f within that ϵ. Therefore, we can reduce the problem of finding missing functions, the problem of machine learning, to a problem of finding the weights of neural networks, which is a well-defined mathematical optimization problem. Why neural networks specifically? That's a fairly good question, since there are many other functions with this property. For example, you will have learned from analysis that a0+a1x+a2x2+…a0+a1x+a2x2+… arbitrary polynomials can be used to approximate any analytic function (this is the Taylor series). Similarly, a Fourier series f(x)=a0+∑kbkcos(kx)+cksin(kx)f(x)=a0+∑kbkcos⁡(kx)+cksin⁡(kx) can approximate any continuous function f (and discontinuous functions also can have convergence, etc. these are the details of a harmonic analysis course). That's all for one dimension. How about two dimensional functions? It turns out it's not difficult to prove that tensor products of universal approximators will give higher dimensional universal approximators. So for example, tensoring together two polynomials: a0+a1x+a2y+a3xy+a4x2y+a5xy2+a6x2y2+…a0+a1x+a2y+a3xy+a4x2y+a5xy2+a6x2y2+… will give a two-dimensional function approximator. But notice how we have to resolve every combination of terms. This means that if we used n coefficients in each dimension d, the total number of coefficients to build a d-dimensional universal approximator from one-dimensional objects would need ndnd coefficients. This exponential growth is known as the curse of dimensionality.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/mlforgl/","page":"ML for GL","title":"ML for GL","text":"A fundamental problem that makes language modeling and other learning problems difficult is the curse of dimensionality. It is particularly obvious in the case when one wants to model the joint distribution between many discrete random variables (such as words in a sentence, or discrete at- tributes in a data-mining task). For example, if one wants to model the joint distribution of 10 consecutive words in a natural language with a vocabulary V of size 100,000, there are potentially 100 00010 − 1 = 1050 − 1 free parameters.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/mlforgl/","page":"ML for GL","title":"ML for GL","text":"From https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorials/mlforgl/","page":"ML for GL","title":"ML for GL","text":"NN Function Background Neural networks (NNs) are a collection of nested functions that are executed on some input data.
